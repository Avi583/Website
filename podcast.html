<p>Liontalk was a podcast that I host that covers both political and philosophical issues. I started Liontalk in my sophomore year at Penn State and recorded a total of 17 episodes (along with a special 18th episode in collaboration with Penn State College Independents). The podcast ran a little over a year from February 25th, 2019 to March 29th 2020. Since I am no longer a Penn State student Liontalk is officially over. </p>
