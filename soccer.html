<p align="center" style = "font-family:Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', 'DejaVu Serif', Georgia, 'serif'">"Anyone can have a good day, but you have to be able to perform on a bad day" - Jurgen Klopp.
	</p>
	<p align="center" style = "font-family:Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', 'DejaVu Serif', Georgia, 'serif'">
	On June 25th 2020 Liverpool finally won the English Premier League. I have been a passionate Liverpool fan for many years now and have decided to analyze some of the tactics utilized by Klopp to create one of the best teams ever in soccer. </p>



<p align="center" style = "font-family:Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', 'DejaVu Serif', Georgia, 'serif'"><h2 align="center">Attack:</h2></p>
	
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/x1G1dZl.png" alt="Liverpool Attack" class="center">

<p align="center" style = "font-family:Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', 'DejaVu Serif', Georgia, 'serif'" align="center">When they have possession Liverpool attacks with a 3-4-1-2. The Defensive Midfielder (DM) (either Fabinho or Henderson this season) drops in between the centre backs (Virgil Van Dijk and Joe Gomez). When fit Fabinho usually plays as a DM and Henderson plays as a Center Midfielder. The pace of both Gomez and Van Dijk helps compensate for having three defenders instead of four defenders. The fullbacks (Robertson and Alexander-Arnold) both press really high, effectively making them wingers. When they get the ball out wide their job is to deliver crosses into the box. Wijnaldum’s job is primarily ball retention, he gets close to whoever has the ball so that he is an easy option to pass to. The other midfielder is a box to box (B2B) midfielder which means that his job is to receive the ball from Liverpool’s half of the field and dribble up to the opponents box. This task is usually performed by Keita, Oxlade Chamberlain or Henderson. Keita is currently the best player on the squad at being a B2B midfielder, Oxlade Chamberlain plays this role late game when Liverpool need a goal because he is really good at shooting from distance and Henderson plays this role when Fabinho is fit. Firmino plays as a false 9. This means that he tracks back to receive passes from the midfield and to create space for both Mane and Salah to score. Mane and Salah play as a Left Forward and Right Forward respectively. They both position themselves in between opposing defenders and try to make runs into the box to score. Salah is very good at counter attacking while Mane is very good at creating chances from nothing.</p>

	<p align="center" style = "font-family:Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', 'DejaVu Serif', Georgia, 'serif'">
When Liverpool defend they usually set up in a 4-3-3. Firmino and Henderson initiate the press to gain back possession. Salah and Mane usually assist the press. The other two midfielders sit in front of the two center backs, and the four defenders maintain a straight line in front of the goal. If Liverpool lose possession when attacking the pace of Van Dijk and especially Gomez helps give both fullbacks enough time to track back. Additionally Alisson frequently comes out of his net to help when both centerbacks are beaten.

<p align="center" style = "font-family:Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', 'DejaVu Serif', Georgia, 'serif'">
When losing or drawing a game Jurgen Klopp typically uses the formation shown below. Oxlade-Chamberlain and Fabinho can both score from distance, while the other two midfielders go wide to help the fullbacks. Robertson and Alexander-Arnold play essentially as wingers who cross the ball into the 18 yard box (also called the penalty box). All three forwards (and sometimes a midfielder if Klopp is really desparate) make movements to get a free header and or close shot inside the 18 yard box. Typically Origi would sub in because at 6'1" he makes a great target man and can easily head the ball in. Defensively only two centerbacks stay back. The centerbacks are sometimes assisted by a deep lying playmaker (Henderson, Milner or Wijnaldum) to build up play from the back.

<p align="center" style = "font-family:Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', 'DejaVu Serif', Georgia, 'serif'">
When winning a game Jurgen Klopp typically uses the formation shown below. This is a tactic called "Parking the bus" where the back four and the midfield four form two striaght lines in front of the net. This formation makes it so that the opponent cannot take shots inside the penalty box and are forced to either cross the ball into the box or shoot from distance. The two strikers chase down whoever has the ball in order to keep the opposing team on their toes. Whenever anyone on our midfield or defence gets the ball they kick it up to either of the two strikers. Typically a Centerback substitution occurs along with Shaqiri in the Striker/Right Wing position or Origi in the striker position.
