<span class=spler" >Really solid T.V. show, I liked the pacing of the show and it definitely feels like something I would enjoy rewatching. You also get to watch how the main cast grows through the three books which was really cool. I particularly liked the dynamic between Zuko and Azula. Zuko always had to work hard to get his way while Azula had natural talent. This dynamic makes the final Agni Kai that much more rewarding to watch. My only gripe is that Ozai was not a well developed villain, I would have liked some sort of backstory and or complexity from him.</span>

<span class=spler" >In general the pacing of Legend of Korra felt off, but this is due to Nickelodeon not green lighting Korra for multiple seasons from the beginning. Books 1,3 and 4. Aman, Zaheer and Khuvira were all compelling villains with a lot of depth. Book 1 tackled the idea of inequality between benders and nonbenders, Book 3 tackled the idea of Tyrrany vs Anarchy and Book 4 touched upon the dangers of facism. All three of these themes were well done in my opinion. Book 2 was the exception. It started off well with the civil war plotline between the two water tribes(possibly setting up a rich vs poor or urban vs rural theme) however it switched to spirits halfway through for no discernable reason. There were also multiple unnecessary recap episodes like halfway through the season. The main villain Unalaq had no clear motivation making him a poorly written antagonist. The finale also had multiple Deus Ex Machina moments tha pissed me off, there was no good reason to have a giant spirit fight. Overall book 2 was awful and almost discouraged me from seeing the rest of Korra. </span>

<span class=spler" >Sports anime just isn't my thing. It's solidly made but there is only so much you can do with high school volleyball. The main characters have a good amount of depth and I think the character interactions was one of the best attributes of the show. Haikyuu also did a good job of building up other teams not just that one that the protagonist is in. I liked the seasons two and three of Haikyuu better. It was really cool watching the Karasuno players develop and work together as a team. Season 4 was a little unrealistic as it seems like every team Karasuno beats in the third set by like two points. I love every character except for Hoshiumi who seems a little unrealistic to me. </span>

<span class=spler" >I don't watch anime that often (the only other anime I have watched is One Punch Man) but I thought JoJo’s was great. The fight scenes are intricate and have a lot of strategy involved rather than just being “I have a higher power level than you so I win”. The show does get ... weird... sometimes but other than that I highly recommend. Part 1 (Phantom Blood) was pretty bad. I was bored like halfway through. The finale was ok I guess. Part 2 (Battle Tendency) was much better. Part 3 was pretty good, but it felt a little long, parts 4 and 5 were amazing.</span>

<p>Death Note:</p>

<p>Rating: 4/10</p>

<span class=spler" >
I feel like I can't get into why I dislike this show without spoiling it, you have been warned

For such a highly rated anime this was a massive disappointment for me. In the anime Light is given a death note where he can kill anyone he wants to by writing their name in it. Light uses the Pseudonym Kira to kill and a detective named L tries to hunt down Light. Light switches from a good person to a psychopath in episode 1 for literally no reason. Every episode afterwards is everyone being suspicious of Light being a murderer, Light proving his innocence and then L not believing it for literally no reason. L is not aware of the death note so why is he still suspicious of Light??? I could power through maybe 3 or 4 episodes of this b.s. But it continued for like 20 episodes. On top of this the love interest between Misa and Light was cringe. I stopped watching after L was killed. It really is a shame because the premise of the anime is very interesting.

<span class=spler" >The Boys is a fantastic show that makes superhumans the antagonists instead of the protagonists. It is very violent, but I think it does a good job of showing this idea. I think the character of Homelander in particular is well done. Anthony Starr truly drives home how scary someone who has superman like powers can be. </span>

<p>Star Wars Clone Wars:</p>

<p>Season 7</p>
<p>Rating: 8/10</p>

<span class=spler" >Fantastic way to wrap up the series. Last couple of episodes brought up the rating from a 7 to an 8.</span>

<p></p>
<br>

<p>Star Wars Clone Wars (2003 / 2D version)</p>
	
<p>Rating: 5/10</p>

<span class=spler" >Great actions scenes but there was little to no plot and or character development.</span>	
<p></p>
<br>

<p>Solar Opposites</p>
	
<p>Rating: 6/10</p>

<span class=spler" >Kirkland brand Rick and Morty. It's a good show to watch if you have nothing else to watch. Very low commitment.</span>
<p></p>
<br>
	
<p>Blood of Zeus</p>
	
<p>Rating: 7/10</p>

<span class=spler" >Short series somewhat based on greek mythology. The story was basic and the characters needed more development, but it was still an enjoyable series. The animation itself was a little clunky at times but the backdrops and the artwork were pretty good. Given that there were only 8, 20 minute episodes this is understandable. I have high hopes for season 2 because I would like to see more adult oriented mythological animations.</span>
<p></p>
<br>

<p>Bojack Horseman</p>
	
<p>Rating: 7/10</p>

<span class=spler" >Took a while to pick up. I would recommend watching the entirety of season 1 before giving up on it. Plot was mediocre but the characters and character development make up for it.</span>

<h3>Movies - Action</h3>
<br>

<p>Wonder Woman</p>

<p>Rating: 7/10</p>


<span class=spler" >Great movie overall, points taken off for really bad roman mythology and an abysmal supporting cast around Wonder Woman (I think it would have been better if it was just Diana and Steve). Looking forward to watching Wonder Woman 1984.</span>

<p></p>
<br>
	
<p>Wonder Woman 1984</p>

<p>Rating: 6/10</p>


<span class=spler" >I went into this movie with really low expectations. I think anyone expecting a serious superhero flick would be left disappointed as some of the fight scenes were comically bad (Like Bollywood level bad) and the CGI for her flying was awful as well. That said I still enjoyed the movie.</span>

<p></p>
<br>
	
<p>The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy</p>
	
<p>Rating: 3/10</p>

<span class=spler" >Again action movies isn't really my thing, if it's your thing this would probably be a 7/8 out of 10. The love interest was awful in terms of acting. Very little plot as with John Wick.</span>

<p></p>
<br>
	
<p>Mask of the Phantasm</p>
	
<p>Rating: 6.5/10</p>

<span class=spler" >Solid animated batman movie, its age does show at times</span>
	
<p></p>
<br>

<p>Jupiter Ascending</p>
	
<p>Rating: 2/10</p>

<span class=spler" >The CGI was very good and the action scenes were decent but the plot was very basic and the characters uncompelling. I would have given a 4/10 but this movie's explanation for anti-gravity hoverboards was “taking an integral” so I had to knock off 2 points for that.</span>

<p></p>
<br>
	
<p>Ready Player One:</p>
	
<p>Rating: 5/10</p>

<span class=spler" >The romance between the two leads was cringy, the rest of the movie was forgettable. Decent CGI I guess?</span>
	
<p></p>
<br>
	
<p>Rogue One:</p>
	
<p>Rating: 7/10</p>

<span class=spler" >Most of the movie was pretty bad and had poor character development, but the end 1/3rd was amazing.</span>

<p></p>
<br>	
	
<p>John Wick</p>
	
<p>Rating: 3/10</p>

<span class=spler" >The fight scenes were realistic and good but there was literally no compelling plot for the entirety of the movie</span>	

<p></p>
<br>
	
<p>Minority Report</p>
	
<p>Rating: 9/10</p>

<span class=spler" >Great movie. The tech was a little outdated but that is to be expected for a movie that came out in 2002.</span>
<p></p>
<br>

<h3>Movies - Other</h3>
<br>
<p>Johnny English</p>
	
<p>Rating: 7/10</p>
	
<span class=spler" >Good comedy for when you just want to sit back and relax. I had to leave about halfway through, but it was still very good.</span>
	
<p></p>
<br>	
	
<p>Shutter Island</p>
	
<p>Rating: 9.5/10</p>

<span class=spler" >Very very good thriller</span>

<p></p>
<br>	
	
<p>Knives Out</p>
	
<p>Rating: 8/10</p>

<span class=spler" >Knives out was a fantastic mystery movie</span>

<p></p>
<br>
	
<p>Parasite</p>
	
<p>Rating: 10/10</p>

<span class=spler" >Truly a masterpiece. The movie is well placed and there are a lot of really good themes and motifs developed over the course of the film.</span>

<p></p>
<br>
	
<p>Arrival</p>
	
<p>Rating: 8/10</p>

<span class=spler" >Really good sci fi movie which strays away from tropes. Very thought provoking. I would recommend not watching trailers / reading in depth reviews and just jumping right in. It gets slow at times but the ending is worth it.</span>
	
<p>Borat 2</p>
	
<p>Rating: 6/10</p>

<span class=spler" >
Mixed bag for me. I felt like the shock value from some of the scenes without paid actors (the RNC bit and the Guliani bit) were diminished by the ones that did have all actors in them (the plastic surgery bit).
</span>

<p></p>
<br>
	
<p>Bad Boys for Life</p>
	
<p>Rating: 8/10</p>

<span class=spler" >

Great goon movie, don't take it too seriously and you will enjoy it.

</span>

<p></p>
<br>
	
	
<p>Interstellar</p>
	
<p>Rating: 9.5/10</p>

<span class=spler" >
This was my third time watching Interstellar. Fantastic movie all around.
