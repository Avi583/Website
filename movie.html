<p>A list of ratings I have given for all T.V. shows and Movies that I have watched in 2020</p>

	
<h2>T.V. Shows</h2>
<p>Avatar: The Last Airbender</p>

<p>Book 1</p>
	
<p>Rating: 8/10</p>
<p>Book 2</p>
	
<p>Rating: 8.5/10</p>

<p>Book 3</p>
	
<p>Rating: 9/10</p>


<span class="spoiler" >Really solid T.V. show, I liked the pacing of the show and it definitely feels like something I would enjoy rewatching. You also get to watch how the main cast grows through the three books which was really cool. I particularly liked the dynamic between Zuko and Azula. Zuko always had to work hard to get his way while Azula had natural talent. This dynamic makes the final Agni Kai that much more rewarding to watch. My only gripe is that Ozai was not a well developed villain, I would have liked some sort of backstory and or complexity from him.</span>
	
<p>The Legend of Korra</p>
	
<p>Book 1</p>
	
<p>Rating: 8/10</p>
<p>Book 2</p>
	
<p>Rating: 4/10</p>

<p>Book 3</p>
	
<p>Rating: 9/10</p>
<p>Book 4</p>
	
<p>Rating: 8/10</p>


<span class="spoiler" >In general the pacing of Legend of Korra felt off, but this is due to Nickelodeon not green lighting Korra for multiple seasons from the beginning. Books 1,3 and 4. Aman, Zaheer and Khuvira were all compelling villains with a lot of depth. Book 1 tackled the idea of inequality between benders and nonbenders, Book 3 tackled the idea of Tyrrany vs Anarchy and Book 4 touched upon the dangers of facism. All three of these themes were well done in my opinion. Book 2 was the exception. It started off well with the civil war plotline between the two water tribes(possibly setting up a rich vs poor or urban vs rural theme) however it switched to spirits halfway through for no discernable reason. There were also multiple unnecessary recap episodes like halfway through the season. The main villain Unalaq had no clear motivation making him a poorly written antagonist. The finale also had multiple Deus Ex Machina moments tha pissed me off, there was no good reason to have a giant spirit fight. Overall book 2 was awful and almost discouraged me from seeing the rest of Korra. </span>
	

<p>Haikyuu</p>
<p>Season 1</p>	
<p>Rating: 6/10</p>

<span class="spoiler" >Sports anime just isn't my thing. It's solidly made but there is only so much you can do with high school volleyball. The main characters have a good amount of depth and I think the character interactions was one of the best attributes of the show. Haikyuu also did a good job of building up other teams not just that one that the protagonist is in. </span>

<p>The Boys</p>
<p>Season 1</p>	
<p>Rating: 9/10</p>
<p>Season 2</p>	
<p>Rating: 9/10</p>
	
<span class="spoiler" >Very good show about the superhero’s being villains. </span>

<h2>Movies</h2>

<p>Wonder Woman</p>

<p>Rating: 7/10</p>


<span class="spoiler" >Great movie overall, points taken off for really bad roman mythology and an abysmal supporting cast around Wonder Woman (I think it would have been better if it was just Diana and Steve). Looking forward to watching Wonder Woman 1984.</span>

<p>The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy</p>
	
<p>Rating: 3/10</p>

<span class="spoiler" >Again action movies isn't really my thing, if it's your thing this would probably be a 7/8 out of 10. The love interest was awful in terms of acting. Very little plot as with John Wick.</span>


<p>Johnny English</p>
	
<p>Rating: 7/10</p>
	
<span class="spoiler" >Good comedy for when you just want to sit back and relax. I had to leave about halfway through, but it was still very good.</span>
	
<p>Knives Out</p>
	
<p>Rating: 8/10</p>

<span class="spoiler" >Knives out was a fantastic mystery movie</span>
	
<p>Shutter Island</p>
	
<p>Rating: 9.5/10</p>

<span class="spoiler" >Very very good thriller</span>

<p>Mask of the Phantasm</p>
	
<p>Rating: 6.5/10</p>

<span class="spoiler" >Solid animated batman movie, its age does show at times</span>

<h3>June Reviews</h3>
	
<p>Jupiter Ascending</p>
	
<p>Rating: 2/10</p>

<span class="spoiler" >The CGI was very good and the action scenes were decent but the plot was very basic and the characters uncompelling. I would have given a 4/10 but this movie's explanation for anti-gravity hoverboards was “taking an integral” so I had to knock off 2 points for that.</span>

<p>Rogue One:</p>
	
<p>Rating: 7/10</p>

<span class="spoiler" >Most of the movie was pretty bad and had poor character development, but the end 1/3rd was amazing.</span>

<p>John Wick</p>
	
<p>Rating: 3/10</p>

<span class="spoiler" >The fight scenes were realistic and good but there was literally no compelling plot for the entirety of the movie</span>
